# LEOFindIt - Android Application

## Overview

LEOFindIt is an Android application designed to detect, classify, and locate Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) devices, with a focus on identifying potentially unwanted tracking devices. [cite: 4, 7, 8] This application is intended for use by law enforcement and civilians who may be victims of stalking or similar situations. [cite: 7, 15]

## Features

* **BTLE Device Detection:** The application scans for nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices and displays them to the user. [cite: 13, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
* **Device Classification:** Users can classify detected devices as safe, unknown, or suspicious. This classification data can be saved persistently. [cite: 13, 14, 25, 26, 27]
* **Device Location:** The application provides functionality to help users locate targeted BTLE devices. [cite: 13, 28, 29, 30, 31]
* **Bug Reporting:** Users can submit bug reports directly through the application to aid in development and maintenance. [cite: 13, 31, 32]

## Architecture

The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, implemented using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

* **Model:**
    * `BtleDevice.kt`: Represents a Bluetooth Low Energy device with properties like name, address, signal strength, and safety status.
    * `BTLEDeviceEntity.kt`: Defines the Room database entity for storing device information.
    * `BTLEDeviceDao.kt`: Provides the Data Access Object (DAO) for interacting with the Room database.
    * `BtleDeviceDatabase.kt`:  Configures the Room database.
* **View:**
    * `DeviceDetailCard.kt`: Composable function to display detailed information about a single BTLE device and allow users to interact with it.
    * `DeviceListView.kt`: Composable function to display a list of detected BTLE devices.
    * `DeviceCard.kt`: Composable function to display a summary of a BTLE device in the device list.
    * `AppTopBar.kt`: Composable function for the application's top app bar.
    * `ScanButton.kt`: Composable function for the button that starts and stops the device scan.
* **Controller:**
    * `BtleViewModel.kt`: ViewModel class that manages the UI-related data and interacts with the Model.
    * `DeviceController.kt`: Handles device scanning and permission requests.
    * `LeoPermissionHandler.kt`:  Manages the requesting of necessary permissions.

## Key Technologies

* Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* RoomDB
* AndroidX Libraries
* Coroutines

## Current Status

The application is currently under development. Key features such as device scanning, device classification, and basic UI elements are implemented. Ongoing work focuses on:

* Enhancing device filtering and sorting.
* Implementing precise device location features.
* Optimizing performance and battery usage.
* Adding more robust error handling.

## Known Issues

* Device name updates may not always be immediately reflected in the UI.
* Toggle switches in the Device Detail Card may exhibit inconsistent behavior.
* Scanning functionality and UI updates require further refinement.

## Future Work

* Implement floor plan database for storing safe/suspicious devices
* Refine the scanning logic to efficiently update device information.
* Extract and Parse UUID to identify manufacturer, device type, and use class
* Enhance the UI to provide better feedback and user guidance.
* Add mapping capabilities for device location.
* Implement user authentication and data synchronization.
* Expand compatibility to a wider range of Android versions.
